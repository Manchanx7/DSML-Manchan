    "### Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with designing a system for a **vehicle rental company**. The company rents out various types of vehicles like **Cars** and **Bikes**, and each vehicle has some shared characteristics but also some distinct ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "1. Each **Vehicle** has attributes such as:\n",
    "   - `vehicle_id`: A unique identifier for the vehicle.\n",
    "   - `brand`: The brand of the vehicle.\n",
    "   - `rental_price`: Price per day to rent the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Both **Car** and **Bike** are types of **Vehicles**.  \n",
    "   - A **Car** has an additional attribute: `number_of_doors`.  \n",
    "   - A **Bike** has an additional attribute: `bike_type` (e.g., mountain bike, racing bike).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You should provide methods to:\n",
    "   - **Calculate total rental cost**: Given the number of rental days, calculate the total cost for any vehicle.\n",
    "   - **Display vehicle details**: For both cars and bikes, display details including the unique attributes (e.g., `number_of_doors` for cars, `bike_type` for bikes).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implement the following OOP concepts:\n",
    "   - **Abstraction**: Provide a clean interface for calculating the total rental cost and displaying vehicle details, hiding the internal logic.\n",
    "   - **Inheritance**: Both **Car** and **Bike** should inherit common functionality from the **Vehicle** class.\n",
    "   - **Polymorphism**: Use method overriding so that the method for displaying vehicle details works differently for cars and bikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a `Vehicle` base class** that implements the common attributes and methods.\n",
    "2. **Define two subclasses `Car` and `Bike`** that inherit from `Vehicle` and implement their specific attributes.\n",
    "3. Use encapsulation by making attributes private and providing public methods to interact with them.\n",
    "4. Use polymorphism to create a `display_details` method that behaves differently for `Car` and `Bike`.\n"
